# endless bento classic
This is the original version of my endless bento game, from before I updated it to generate its own puzzles. Just in case you like these original puzzles more than the random ones that the new version spits out. [Play here!](https://esmane.github.io/endless-bento-classic/)

## How are the puzzles generated?
The puzzles are actually not randomly generated but rather randomly chosen from a list of 20 premade puzzles. This is actually the same way it was done in the original game (special thanks to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdZdbBqDUuM) for helping me figure all this out), and so these puzzles are the exact same ones that appear in *Shadow at the Water's Edge*. In order to create the illusion that there are more than 20 different puzzles, the game randomly assigns a different color and shape to the colors and shapes described in the predefined solution (does this make sense), randomly rotates the solution and clues, and randomly arranges the clues on the screen. 10 of the 20 puzzles are Junior level difficulty, and the other 10 are Senior level difficulty. If you want only Junior or only Senior puzzles to be chosen you can change this under "menu". You can also choose random in which case every puzzle has an equal chance of being chosen.
