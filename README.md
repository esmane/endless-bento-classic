# endless bento classic
This is the original version of my endless-bento game, from before I updated it to generate truly random puzzles. Just in case you like the pregenerated game puzzles more than the random ones that my new version spits out.

## How are the puzzles generated?
The puzzles are actually not randomly generated but rather randomly chosen from a list of 20 puzzles. This is actually the same way it was done in the original game (special thanks to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdZdbBqDUuM) video for helping me figure this all out, I wouldn't have been able to make this without those solutions). In order to create the illusion that there are more than 20 different puzzles, the game randomly assigns a different color and shape to the colors and shapes described in the predefined solution (does this make sense) and also randomly arranges the clues on the screen. 10 of the 20 puzzles are Junior level difficulty, and the other 10 are Senior level difficulty. If you want only Junior or only Senior puzzles to be chosen you can change this under menu. You can also choose random in which case every puzzle has an equal chance of being chosen.
